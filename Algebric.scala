// Exercise 4: Playing around with Algebra.
// A monoid is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with a 
// single associative binary operation and an identity element. E.g., the 
// set of booleans with the or operator is a monoid whose identity is false.

// A group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an 
// operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element. 
// To qualify as a group, the set and the operation must satisfy a few conditions 
// called group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. 
// E.g., the set Z (the integers with sign) with the + operator is a group but 
// with the * is not since inverting the operation break the closure property.

// A ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with two 
// binary operations (usually called addition and multiplication), where each 
// operation combines two elements to form a third element. 
// To qualify as a ring, the set together with its two operations must satisfy 
// certain conditions, namely, the set must be an abelian (i.e., commutative) 
// group under addition and a monoid under multiplication such that multiplication 
// distributes over addition.

// Write the Monoid, Group and Ring classess implementing the monoids, 
// groups and rings algebraic structures respectively. Each class must be 
// parametric on the algebraic sort, in the sense that the operations and the 
// sets are not a priori defined and they should implement operations to check 
// the properties characterizing the algebraic structure.

// Test your implementation with the following examples (S is the set, 
// add=additive operation, mul=multiplicative operation, i=identity):

// Monoids

// S = {True, False} add = or i = False
// S = Zn={0,1,...,n-1} add = + where a+b=(a+b)%n i = 0

//Groups

// S = {True, False}, add = or, i = False
// S = Z, add = +, i = 0
// S = Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, add = * where a*b=(a*b)%4, i = 1
// S = {a}*, add: {a}*Ã—{a}* --> {a}* where x1Â·x2 is x1 if #x1 > #x2, x2 otherwise, i = the empty string

// Rings

// S = {0} add = + where 0+0=0 mul = * where 0*0=0 i = 0
// S = Z add = + mul = * i = 0
// S = Z4 = {0,1,2,3} add = + where a+b=(a+b)%4 mul = * where a*b=(a*b)%4 i = 0
// Note property checks on infinite sets should be on a finite subset.
